## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### 1. Portfolio/Samples/Templates Consolidation
**Issue**: Three separate systems causing confusion
- Portfolio: Public showcase of work samples
- Samples: Download links for examples
- Templates: Backend-only resources

**Solution**: 
```
/portfolio - Showcase completed projects with case studies
/samples - Public downloadable examples organized by industry
/templates - Private/client-only downloadable templates
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Audit existing download files in `/public/downloads/`
- [ ] Reorganize into clear categories
- [ ] Update all internal links
- [ ] Create unified navigation structure

### 2. Unified Login System
**Issue**: Multiple login points (Admin Login in hero, Client Portal button)
**Current State**: Admin Login still appears in hero section

**Solution**: Single `/login` page with role-based routing
```
/login → Authentication → Route based on credentials:
├── Admin → /admin/dashboard
├── Client → /client/dashboard  
├── Co-op Member → /coop/dashboard
└── Super Admin → /superadmin/dashboard
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create unified login page
- [ ] Remove "Admin Login" from hero section
- [ ] Implement role-based routing logic
- [ ] Update navigation to show single "Login" link

### 3. Non-Functional Interactive Elements
**Issue**: Save Draft and Activate AI Workflow buttons don't work
**Current State**: Buttons render but have no backend functionality

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Implement draft saving functionality
- [ ] Create AI workflow activation system
- [ ] Add proper form validation and error handling
- [ ] Connect to backend storage system

### 4. Dark/Light Mode Reliability Issues
**Issue**: Theme toggle sometimes fails, inconsistent state management
**Current State**: Basic toggle exists but unreliable

**Solution**: Implement robust theme system
```typescript
// Enhanced theme management with:
- Persistent storage (localStorage)
- System preference detection
- Reliable state synchronization
- Server-side rendering support
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Implement enhanced theme provider
- [ ] Add system preference detection
- [ ] Ensure SSR compatibility
- [ ] Add theme transition animations

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Add complete team member profiles
- [ ] Include professional backgrounds from resume files
- [ ] Add company history and mission statement

### 6. Contact Form Backend Integration
**Current State**: Form renders but backend integration unknown
**Action Items**:
- [ ] Implement form submission handling
- [ ] Add email notification system
- [ ] Create lead management system
- [ ] Add form validation and error handling

### 7. Resource Blocks Disappearing Issue
**Issue**: Some resource blocks intermittently disappear
**Potential Causes**:
- React hydration issues
- State management problems
- CSS conflicts

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Debug React rendering issues
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add loading states for all dynamic content
- [ ] Test across different browsers/devices
